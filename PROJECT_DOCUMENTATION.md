| Hours logged to wrong projects | Project & activity master controlled by admin |
| No visibility into team utilisation | Approver dashboard with charts and KPIs |
| Compliance & audit requirements | Immutable approval history + full audit log |
| Backdating abuse | Configurable backdating window (default 7 days) |
| Report export for billing | Excel & PDF export from reports module |

### Tech Stack at a Glance

## 2. User Roles & Permissions

HourHive uses a **two-role model** augmented by a per-user **permission flag**.

### Roles

| Role | Value in DB | Who holds it |
|---|---|---|
| Super Admin | `super_admin` | System administrator / HR admin |
| Employee | `employee` | All other staff, including managers |

### Manager Concept

There is **no separate Manager role**. A manager is simply an `employee` with:
- `manager_id` populated on their direct reports (they are assigned as someone's manager)
- `can_approve_timesheets = true` (toggled by Super Admin)

On their sidebar, manager-employees see an **Approvals** menu item that ordinary employees do not.

### Permission Matrix

## 4. Modules & Features

### 4.1 Authentication

#### Features
- **Email/password login** with JWT access + refresh tokens
- **Self-registration** (creates an `employee` account; Super Admin promotes as needed)
- **Forgot password** — sends reset link to registered email via SMTP
- **Reset password** — tokenised link valid for 2 hours
- **Change password** — requires current password for verification
- **Auto token refresh** — Axios interceptor silently refreshes on 401 and retries the original request
- **Account deactivation guard** — inactive users are blocked at login

#### Token Lifecycle

```
Access Token  : 60 minutes (configurable)
Refresh Token : 7 days (configurable)
Reset Token   : 2 hours (one-time use)
```

#### Password Rules
- Stored as bcrypt hash (no plain-text ever persisted)
- Temp passwords generated on admin-created accounts; user must change on first login
- Reset tokens are invalidated after use (set to `NULL` in DB)

---

|---|---|
| Current Month Hours | Total hours logged in the current calendar month |
| Submitted / Pending / Approved / Rejected | Count of weekly timesheet statuses |
| Weekly Hours Trend | Bar chart — last 4 weeks |

---

### 4.3 Timesheet Entry

The core module. Employees log work hours daily or via weekly grid.

#### Daily Entry Form (`/timesheets/entry`)
- Select **Project** (active projects dropdown)
- Select **Activity** (active activities dropdown)
- Enter **Work Date** (today or backdated within limit)
- Enter **Hours** (0.25 increments, max configured daily limit)
- Optional **Description** (free text)
- Toggle **Billable** flag
- Multiple entries allowed per day (different project/activity combinations)

#### Weekly Grid View (`/timesheets/weekly`)
- Mon–Sun grid with rows per project/activity combination
- Editable cells for each day
- Row totals and day totals auto-calculated
- **Copy Day** — copies all entries from one date to another (shortcut for repetitive work)
- Submit button at week level (submits entire week to approver)

#### Timesheet List (`/timesheets`)
- Paginated list of all submitted/approved/rejected weeks
- Status badges
- Click to drill into a week's details

#### Status Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> DRAFT : First entry saved
    DRAFT --> SUBMITTED : Employee submits
    SUBMITTED --> APPROVED : Manager approves
    SUBMITTED --> REJECTED : Manager rejects (comment required)
    REJECTED --> DRAFT : Employee sees rejection reason
    DRAFT --> SUBMITTED : Employee resubmits
    APPROVED --> DRAFT : Manager/Admin unlocks
```

---

### 4.4 Timesheet Approvals

Available to Super Admin and employees with `can_approve_timesheets = true`.

#### Pending Queue (`/approvals`)
- Lists all timesheets with status `SUBMITTED` or `RESUBMITTED`
- **Managers** see only their direct reports' timesheets
- **Super Admin** sees every timesheet in the system

#### Actions
| Action | Who | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Approve | Manager / Super Admin | Sets status → APPROVED, locks timesheet |
| Reject | Manager / Super Admin | Requires comment; sets status → REJECTED, unlocks |
| Unlock | Manager / Super Admin | Only on APPROVED timesheets; reverts to DRAFT for editing |

#### Approval History
Every action (submit, approve, reject, unlock, resubmit) is written to an immutable `approval_history` table with:
- Actor, timestamp, action type
- Previous and new status
- Optional comment

This provides a complete **audit trail per timesheet**.

---

### 4.5 Reports & Analytics

#### Report Types

| Report | Filters | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Daily Report | Date range, employee, project | Row per entry: date · employee · project · activity · hours · billable |
| Monthly Summary | Month, year, employee | Row per employee: total hours · working days · avg daily hours |
| Project Effort | Date range, project | Row per project: total · billable · non-billable hours |
| Activity Breakdown | Date range, employee | Row per activity: hours + percentage of total |

|---|---|---|
| `backdated_days_limit` | 7 | How many days back employees can log time |
| `max_daily_hours` | 12 | Maximum hours allowed per employee per day |

Changes take effect immediately without restarting the server.

---

## 5. Business Rules

### Timesheet Rules

1. **Minimum increment**: Hours must be entered in **0.25 (15-minute) multiples**. Values like 1.3 or 2.7 are rejected.
2. **Daily cap**: Total hours per employee per day cannot exceed `max_daily_hours` (default 12).
3. **No future dates**: Work dates in the future are rejected at the API level.
4. **Backdating window**: Work dates older than `backdated_days_limit` days are rejected.
5. **Week boundaries**: Timesheets are per Mon–Sun week. An entry on any day of the week auto-creates or attaches to that week's header.
6. **Locked timesheets**: Once a week is approved, all entries are **locked** (`is_locked = true`). Edits require an unlock action from the manager or Super Admin.
7. **Submission**: An employee can submit only **DRAFT** or **REJECTED** (resubmit) timesheets.

### Approval Rules

1. **Scope**: A manager can approve only timesheets belonging to their **direct reports**.
2. **Super Admin override**: Super Admin can approve, reject, or unlock **any** timesheet.
3. **Rejection requires comment**: The API enforces a non-empty comment on reject.
4. **Unlock is reversible**: Unlocking an approved timesheet sets it back to DRAFT, allowing re-entry and re-submission.
5. **History is immutable**: `approval_history` rows are never updated or deleted.

### User Rules

1. **Self-registration** creates employee accounts only. Role escalation requires Super Admin.
2. **Deactivating** a user blocks login but preserves all historical timesheet data.
3. **Employee code** is auto-generated at creation and cannot be changed.
4. **A user can have at most one manager** (single `manager_id`).
5. **A manager is still an employee** — they log their own timesheets and their timesheets are approved by their own manager (or Super Admin).

### Project & Activity Rules

1. Only **active** projects and activities appear in timesheet dropdowns.
2. Deactivating a project/activity does not alter historical timesheet entries.
3. Project codes and activity codes must be globally unique.

### Data Integrity

1. **Soft deletes** everywhere: `is_deleted = true` flag; records are never physically removed.
2. **Cascade deletes**: Deleting a `timesheet_header` cascades to its `timesheet_detail` rows and `approval_history` rows.
3. **Audit logging**: Every CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE action on entities is logged with before/after JSON snapshots.

| `profile.store` | Zustand | ❌ | Profile page local state |
| Server state | React Query | Cache only | All API data fetching |

### Data Fetching Pattern

```javascript
// React Query pattern used everywhere
const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["projects", search, status, page],
  queryFn: () => projectsService.list({ search, status, page }),
  placeholderData: (prev) => prev,   // keeps previous data while loading
});

// Mutations with cache invalidation
const createMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: (d) => projectsService.create(d),
  onSuccess: () => { qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["projects"] }); },
});
```

### Token Refresh Flow

```mermaid

    C->>S: GET /timesheets/weekly (expired token)
    S-->>C: 401 Unauthorized
    C->>S: POST /auth/refresh {refresh_token}
    S-->>C: New access_token + refresh_token
    C-->>C: Update localStorage
    C->>S: Retry: GET /timesheets/weekly (new token)
    S-->>C: 200 OK

## 12. FAQ

**Q: How does an employee become a manager?**
Super Admin goes to `/users`, edits the employee, and toggles the **"Can Approve Timesheets"** switch. Then other employees are assigned to that person via **Assign Manager**. The employee will now see the Approvals menu in their sidebar.

**Q: Can a manager see all timesheets or only their team's?**
Only their direct reports' timesheets appear in their pending queue. Super Admin sees everything.

**Q: What happens if an employee submits a timesheet but their manager is on leave?**
Super Admin can approve any timesheet. There is no escalation or delegation mechanism currently.

**Q: Can an employee log 0 hours?**
No. The minimum entry is 0.25 hours. Entries with 0 hours are rejected by Pydantic validation.

**Q: Can hours be entered on weekends?**
Yes. The system does not enforce weekday-only logging. Holidays are tracked but not blocked at entry time.

**Q: What is the maximum timesheet history retained?**
There is no automatic purge. All data is retained indefinitely (soft-deleted records included).

**Q: Can a manager edit an employee's timesheet directly?**
No. Only the employee who owns the timesheet can add/edit/delete entries. The manager can only approve, reject, or unlock.

**Q: Is the system multi-company / multi-tenant?**
No. The current architecture is single-tenant (one company per deployment).

**Q: How are backdating limits enforced?**
On every `POST /timesheets/entries`, the service reads `backdated_days_limit` from `system_config` and rejects `work_date` values older than that many days.

**Q: Can an employee assign themselves as a project manager?**
No. Project manager assignment is done by Super Admin only during project creation or editing.

**Q: What email provider is used?**
Gmail SMTP by default. Any SMTP provider can be configured via `.env` variables.

**Q: Can reports be auto-scheduled / emailed?**
Not currently. APScheduler infrastructure is in place for reminder emails, but scheduled report delivery is not implemented.

## 13. Known Missing Features

The following features are absent from the current codebase and represent gaps versus typical enterprise timesheet systems:

### Core Gaps

| # | Missing Feature | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **No in-app notifications** | Employees and managers have no real-time alerts; only email notifications |
| 2 | **No notification bell / inbox UI** | `notification_log` table exists in DB but no frontend UI reads it |
| 3 | **No System Config UI page** | `system_config` can only be changed via direct API calls; no admin UI |
| 4 | **No bulk approval** | Managers must approve one timesheet at a time |
| 5 | **No delegation / out-of-office** | If a manager is unavailable, only Super Admin can cover approvals |
| 6 | **No first-login password change enforcement** | System generates temp passwords but does not force immediate change |
| 7 | **No employee self-editing of profile** | Employees cannot update their own department, designation, or phone number |
| 8 | **No leave/absence tracking** | No integration between holidays/leaves and expected hours |
| 9 | **No timesheet reminder scheduler UI** | APScheduler backend exists but no admin control over reminder times |
| 10 | **No mobile / responsive layout** | UI is desktop-first; not optimised for mobile browsers |

### Reporting Gaps

| # | Missing Feature | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| 11 | **No billable vs. non-billable client report** | Cannot email project effort breakdown to clients directly |
| 12 | **No utilisation rate report** | Cannot measure % of capacity utilised per employee |
| 13 | **No overtime / over-budget alerts** | No threshold alerts when project hours exceed budget |
| 14 | **No scheduled report delivery** | Reports must be manually pulled; no automated weekly email digest |
| 15 | **No saved report templates** | Users must re-enter all filters on every visit |

### Access & Security Gaps

| # | Missing Feature | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| 16 | **No Google OAuth / SSO** | All users must remember a separate password |
| 17 | **No MFA / 2FA** | Single-factor only |
| 18 | **No IP allowlist / session management** | Cannot restrict access to office network |
| 19 | **No password complexity policy enforcement** | Weak passwords are accepted |
| 20 | **No rate limiting on auth endpoints** | Brute-force risk on `/auth/login` |

## 14. Enterprise Improvement Suggestions

### Priority 1 — Must Have (Before Production at Scale)

#### 1. Role-Based Access Refinement
Add a `department_admin` role between Super Admin and Employee. Department admins manage only users and projects within their own department, reducing bottlenecks on a single Super Admin.

#### 2. Delegation / Approver Fallback
Allow a manager to designate a backup approver for a date range. When the primary is unavailable, the system automatically routes pending approvals to the backup.

#### 3. Force First-Login Password Change
After admin creates an account with a temp password, set a `must_change_password` flag. Block all non-auth API access until the password is changed.

#### 4. Rate Limiting & Brute-Force Protection
Add `slowapi` or Nginx rate limiting on:
- `POST /auth/login` — max 5 attempts per minute per IP
- `POST /auth/forgot-password` — max 3 per hour per email

#### 5. Notification Inbox UI
Surface the existing `notification_log` table as a bell icon in the top nav with a count badge and a dropdown list. Mark-as-read and bulk-clear actions.

#### 6. System Config Admin Page
Add a `/config` frontend page that lists all `system_config` keys as editable form fields. Changes take immediate effect without a restart.

---

### Priority 2 — High Value (Q2/Q3)

#### 7. SSO / OAuth Integration
Integrate with Google Workspace or Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD). Employees log in with their company email using SAML 2.0 or OIDC, eliminating password management overhead.

#### 8. Multi-Tenant Architecture
Introduce an `organisation` table as the top-level tenant. All other records get an `org_id` FK. This allows SaaS deployment where multiple companies share one instance with full data isolation.

#### 9. Bulk Timesheet Operations
- Bulk approve: Select multiple timesheets in the pending queue and approve in one click.
- Bulk reject: Same for rejection with a shared comment.
- Batch import: Upload a CSV of timesheet entries for mass data migration.

#### 10. Scheduled Report Delivery
Let Super Admin configure weekly/monthly report emails:
- Recipient(s), report type, filters, format (Excel/PDF)
- Delivered automatically by APScheduler (infrastructure already exists)

#### 11. Project Budget & Hours Tracking
Add `budgeted_hours` to `project_master`. Dashboard shows a burn-down chart per project. Alert fires (email + in-app) when 80% and 100% of budget is consumed.

#### 12. Leave Integration
Add a `leave_request` table. When an employee is on approved leave, the timesheet entry UI marks those days differently and the reporting module excludes them from utilisation calculations.

---

### Priority 3 — Enterprise Grade (Q4+)

#### 13. Audit Log Immutability Guarantee
Move `audit_log` writes to a separate append-only database user that has only `INSERT` privilege (no `UPDATE`/`DELETE`). This provides a tamper-proof trail that satisfies SOC 2 and ISO 27001 auditors.

#### 14. API Gateway & Microservices Split
Split the monolith into:
- `auth-service` — JWT issuance, OAuth
- `timesheet-service` — entry, submission, approvals
- `report-service` — heavy aggregation queries
- `notification-service` — email, in-app, push

This improves independent scalability; report exports do not slow down timesheet entry for users.

#### 15. Real-Time Collaboration (WebSocket)
Use FastAPI WebSockets to push live updates:
- Manager's approval queue updates in real time when employees submit
- Employee's timesheet status badge changes when manager approves/rejects (no manual refresh)

#### 16. Mobile App (React Native / PWA)
Convert the frontend into a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline support so field employees can log time without internet and sync when connected.

#### 17. HRIS Integration
Provide webhook endpoints for two-way sync with:
- **HRM systems** (SAP SuccessFactors, Darwinbox, Keka) — employee creation, department changes
- **Payroll systems** — send approved hours for payroll calculation

#### 18. Data Warehouse / BI Connector
Expose a read-replica connection or a REST export endpoint that BI tools (Power BI, Tableau, Metabase) can query for company-wide analytics without impacting the production database.

#### 19. Compliance & Data Residency
- Implement GDPR right-to-erasure: anonymise (not hard-delete) user PII while retaining timesheet history
- Support configurable data residency (e.g., India-only MySQL region)
- Add data retention policies: auto-archive records older than N years

#### 20. AI-Powered Insights
- **Anomaly detection**: flag unusual patterns (e.g., employee logs 11h on the same task every Friday)
- **Project overrun prediction**: regression model on burn rate to predict overshoot
- **Auto-fill suggestions**: suggest project/activity based on the employee's historical patterns when opening timesheet entry
